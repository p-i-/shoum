# Speak — Architecture

Component map, runtime layout, and the hard-won invariants. For the user-facing
overview see [README.md](README.md); for the forward path see [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Build

No Xcode project. `build.sh` compiles `SpeakApp/SpeakApp/*.swift` with `swiftc`,
assembles the `.app` bundle, writes Info.plist, and **ad-hoc signs** it
(`codesign --sign -`). A locally-built binary has no quarantine attribute, so
Gatekeeper is satisfied and ad-hoc signing is enough for TCC (mic/accessibility).
Adding a source file means dropping it in that directory — nothing to register.

- `build.sh` — compile the app (dev).
- `run.sh` — run from the clone, foreground logs; one instance at a time (stops/relaunches the installed app so they don't fight).
- `install.sh` — the user-facing installer (see "Install layout" below).

## Run modes & on-disk layout

Mode is detected by the **install location itself** — no env var. A
`whisper-server` file inside the bundle's `Resources` means "installed";
otherwise the app walks up to find the clone ("dev"). `Config` resolves three
roots:

| | dev (run.sh) | installed (/Applications) |
|---|---|---|
| **resourceRoot** (binary, sample wav) | the clone | `…app/Contents/Resources` |
| **dataRoot** (config.yaml, prompt.txt, server.log) | the clone | `~/Library/Application Support/Speak` |
| **model store** (`.bin` + `-encoder.mlmodelc`) | shared store, else clone `whisper.cpp/models` | shared store |
| **app log** | clone `log.txt` | `~/Library/Logs/Speak/speak.log` |

**Shared model store** = `~/Library/Application Support/Speak/models` (overridable
via `model_dir`). The heavy ~2 GB assets live there **once** and are reused by
both dev and installed runs — no duplication. `install.sh` *moves* them out of
the clone into the store, so deleting the clone leaves exactly one copy. Chosen
over baking the model into the bundle (a "fat self-contained .app") precisely to
avoid that duplication; since distribution is compile-from-source, the bundle
never needed to carry the model.

Installed-mode user files are seeded once from bundled `config.default.yaml` /
`prompt.default.txt` on first run, so the data dir survives deletion.

## Install layout (install.sh)

1. Preflight (arm64, CLT, cmake, swiftc, python3); refuse if the app already
   exists (**no v1 upgrade path** — reinstall = delete then install).
2. Clone whisper.cpp, download the model.
3. Build `whisper-server` **static** (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`) → one fat
   binary with no `@rpath` dylib deps. Asserts self-containment via `otool -L`.
4. Generate the ANE encoder (one-time python conversion).
5. Build SpeakApp, stage a **thin** bundle (binary + sample + config seeds, ~4 MB).
6. `mv` the model assets into the shared store.
7. Re-sign inside-out (nested binary first, then the bundle), verify, launch.

## Hard-won invariants (DO NOT REGRESS)

1. **Never measure key-press durations with processing-time clocks.** The event
   tap delivers on the main run loop; main-thread work inflates apparent
   durations. `CGEvent.timestamp` (hardware time) is the only truth. Its units
   vary by system — `KeyMonitor` calibrates against the system clock at runtime.
2. **`AVAudioConverter` with rate conversion returns `.inputRanDry`** for the
   normal single-buffer case; its output frames are still valid. Dropping them
   records empty files.
3. **whisper-server reports some failures as HTTP 200 with an error-JSON body**;
   `Transcriber` checks for that.
4. **The ANE compile cache is fragile** (entries evict each other; running
   whisper-cli benchmarks evicts the server's entry). Expect occasional ~35 s
   recompiles. macOS caches the compiled blob but it's evictable and not
   ship-able — there is no supported way to pin or relocate it.
5. **The CoreML encoder is resolved relative to the `.bin`.** The `mlmodelc`
   MUST be a sibling of the model file in the same dir (true in both the clone's
   `whisper.cpp/models` and the shared store).
6. **whisper-server is dylib-linked in a shared build.** Its `@rpath` deps point
   at absolute clone paths, so the installed app uses a **static** build instead
   (see install.sh). Don't ship the shared binary.
7. **Never set `contentTintColor` on a template SF Symbol in an
   `NSStatusBarButton`** — it renders nothing (the menu-bar vibrancy compositor
   and the forced tint don't reconcile; the button reports fully healthy while
   drawing zero pixels). Colour a tray icon via
   `NSImage.SymbolConfiguration(hierarchicalColor:)` (a non-template coloured
   image); use a plain template image when uncoloured. (Cost us two
   misdiagnoses — see invariant 9.)
8. **Every failure path logs.** If something breaks silently, the bug is that it
   broke silently.
9. **Unobservable subsystem → instrument before theorising.** The tray bug was
   misdiagnosed twice from plausible mental models; it fell in one read once the
   button's actual state was dumped (a controlled `tint=nil` vs `tint=green`
   comparison). Compiling ≠ working. When something is hard to see, add the
   observation first; don't guess-and-rebuild.
10. **Sequence permission dialogs; never fire the Accessibility prompt at
    launch.** Auto-prompting it at startup (the pre-v1.0 bug) stacks it with the
    mic dialog as an unanchored popup before any window exists. Fire it only
    AFTER the mic dialog resolves and the window is foregrounded
    (`AppDelegate.autoPromptAccessibilityIfNeeded`). `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`
    is one-shot — it registers the app and shows the dialog only until then — so
    the Status window's "Open Settings…" button must NAVIGATE to the pane (URL),
    not re-call the prompt. As an `LSUIElement` app we can't reliably hold
    activation through the System-Settings round-trip: `orderFrontRegardless`
    plus a one-shot post-onboarding re-foreground bring our window back (Stage
    Manager can still override — accept it; the green tray is the done-signal).
